# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
<p align="justify"> Speech emotion recognition (SER) is the ability to identify the type of emotion from human speech, intending to create a natural interaction between humans and computers or commonly known as human-computer interaction (HCI). To increase human satisfaction while using digital devices such as computers and smartphones, the development of HCI is very much needed. Therefore, in this project, I will design a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification. </p>
